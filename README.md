## Features

- **Ambient Light:** General lighting for the scene with adjustable intensity and color.
- **Directional Light:** Parallel light rays suitable for simulating sunlight, with position and helper controls.
- **Hemisphere Light:** Gradient sky and ground lighting with customizable colors.
- **Point Light:** Omni-directional light source with distance and decay settings.
- **Rect Area Light:** Rectangular light with width, height, and position controls.
- **Spot Light:** Focused light beam with adjustable angle, distance, and penumbra.
